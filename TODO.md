# TODO 
### February, 21, 2025
## THIS TIME
1. Test PTC and begin writing firmware R1 
    - start with a flow chart or pseudo-code
2. Continue reviewing and editing PCB
    - ask someone else to look ino over 
3. Figure out how to attach LED's to board 
    - (Talk to Phil)
4. Look at inventory and create BOM for 2nd revision
    - Low priority

## Last Time 
1. Could not find a solution directly using the charge controller or regulator, have decided to monitor witht he ADC of the MCU. Will add a volatge divider incase its necessary but i belive i will be able to meaure directly witht he ADC. 
2. Have finshed a first draft of the PCB, and will review it over the next week or so,and then ask Aaron or Phil to take a look. Then it will sit until i have MONEYS to order the next revision
3. Have created  a project for the firware and included some files to tets out the onboard PTC

1. Find a solution to prevent over drawing from battery
    - EIther monitor with MCU or LVD in power suplt/charge controller
2. Begin on PCB layout for rev2
    - Reference rev1 notes
3. Start writing firmware
    - Figure out PTC
    - start with flow chart?
