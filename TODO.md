- [ ] **Continue PCB review**  

### Last Time (February 21, 2025)  
- [x] **Decided to monitor battery voltage via MCU ADC**  
  - Voltage divider optional if direct measurement is unstable  
- [x] **First draft of PCB finished**  
  - Will get **Aaron/Phil to review** before ordering Rev2  
- [x] **Firmware project started**  
  - Initial tests for **onboard PTC** were inconclusive

## February 21, 2025  

### This Time  
- [ ] **Test PTC and begin writing firmware R1**  
  - Start with a **flowchart or pseudo-code**  
- [ ] **Continue reviewing and editing PCB**  
  - Ask someone else to look it over  
- [ ] **Figure out how to attach LEDs to the board**  
  - Talk to Phil  
- [ ] **Look at inventory and create BOM for Rev2** (low priority)  

### Last Time (February 13, 2025)  
- [x] **Could not find a solution directly using the charge controller or regulator**  
  - Decided to monitor voltage using **MCU ADC** instead  
  - Added a voltage divider in case it's necessary  
- [x] **First draft of PCB completed**  
  - Plan to review it over the next week and get feedback from Aaron or Phil  
- [x] **Firmware project created**  
  - Initial tests for onboard PTC

## February 13, 2025  

### This Time  
- [ ] **Find a solution to prevent over-drawing from the battery**  
  - Either monitor with MCU or use LVD in power supply/charge controller  
- [ ] **Begin PCB layout for Rev2**  
  - Reference Rev1 notes  
- [ ] **Start writing firmware**  
  - Figure out **PTC**  
  - Start with **flowchart or pseudo-code**  

### Last Time  
- [x] **Started working on Rev1 firmware**  
- [x] **Confirmed initial hardware functionality**
